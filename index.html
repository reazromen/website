  <h1>Reaz Romen's Website</h1>
  <p>Hey folks, I'm Reaz Romen, a Cloud Infrastructure Architect and DevOps practitioner. Like to talk about cloud and automation! I've been knee-deep in AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and more. But hey, I'm not just a tech geek ‚Äì I'm also a lifelong learner, always hungry for new concepts and ideas.
     You'll often find me tinkering with system designs, automating deployments, and diving deep into incident management. When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably nose-deep in a book, soaking up knowledge like a sponge. Let's geek out together over cloud strategies, automation tactics, IOT and all things tech!  I'm not just about the tech lingo though ‚Äì I'm a lifelong learner and a tech enthusiast. üöÄ</p>

  <h2> What's the deal with simplicity, anyway??</h2>
  <ul>
   Picture this: you're tinkering with your grandma's ancient Wi-Fi, trying to dodge those pesky ads like you're in a virtual dodgeball match, when suddenly‚Äîboom!‚Äîyou land on my site. No heavy images slowing your browser to a crawl, no videos buffering like it's dial-up all over again. Just good ol' plain text, easier to navigate than coding with mittens on. And hey, I've got more useful stuff packed in here than a Swiss Army knife at a tech expo, and it won't cost you a dime. So why keep it simple? Because in the chaotic world of IT, simplicity is the unsung hero that saves the day.

  <p> I built this site and file SHA256 hashes using CI/CD techniques in AWS. 
    SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, often rendered as a 64-character hexadecimal number. It is part of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family and is widely used in various security applications and protocols, including SSL/TLS, PGP, SSH, IPsec, and more.</p>
  <p> You can skip TLS and directly access website stuff via insecure HTTP <a href="#">here</a>. Skipping TLS can reduce CPU usage and save power, which might be beneficial in resource-constrained environments. </p>
